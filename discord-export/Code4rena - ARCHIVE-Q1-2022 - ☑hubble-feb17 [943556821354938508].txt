Hey folks 👋  Super excited to be here. Happy to answer any questions.

Some details:
Hubble Exchange is a vAMM based decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It's a multi-collateral and cross-margining system - the trading experience is similar to FTX. The closest project similar to ours is Perpetual Protocol V2 (Curie).

Hubble vAMM: CurveCrypto Invariant
Automatic market-makers (AMMs) are one of the major innovations which decentralized finance has brought. They use the maths function to price assets when exchanging two or more tokens. First, Uniswap brought markets created by $x·y = k$ invariant which doesn’t make any assumption about the pricing of underlying assets and spreads liquidity acros...

market twap price comes from the snapshots i.e. that is a twap of recent trades. index twap price comes from a trusted oracle and should represent the actual price of the asset. 
The premium is a fee users pay (or receive) if there is a difference between the market price and index price in an attempt to equate them.
This is a decent explainer https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797443-perpetual-funding-rate#:~:text=The%20minimum%20funding%20rate%20is,maximum%20funding%20rate%20is%200.75%25.
